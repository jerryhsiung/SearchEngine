SearchEngine
===========

This is my project from my Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming class that uses an interface created using Qt, which searches for keywords in text files. There is also a page rank option to rank the "webpages" or text files by popularity.

###Compile & Run Instructions
For best results, run in Linux.
